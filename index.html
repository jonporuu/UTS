      <h2>Economic Self</h2>

      <h2>Physical and Mental Health</h2>
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Each day people wake-up and face these challenges. This is no easy task but that is how it is to survive and exist in an ever-changing modern world. Unfortunately, as people carry-on with their tasks and routines, they experience stress.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Academic pressure, Financial Difficulties, Mental Disorders, Relationships, Time Management</p>
      <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Slow Down - Life can feel like a constant race, but pushing through without rest can wear you down. Taking even a few moments to pause, breathe, or do something calming helps your mind reset. Slowing down gives you space to think clearly and see that many challenges are more manageable than they seem.</p>

      <h2>Spiritual Self</h2>
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The Spiritual Self is often described as the deepest part of our identity — the core of who we are beyond our physical body, emotions, and thoughts.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Lack of time or busy lifestyle - A hectic schedule filled with work, school, and personal responsibilities can leave little room for moments of quiet reflection, making it difficult to explore one's spiritual needs or growth.</p>
      <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Understanding and nurturing the spiritual self is essential for living a meaningful and authentic life. It allows us to connect with our inner values, act with integrity, and find purpose beyond material success or social validation. </p>
